# Stat-altered-companion

Hi, my name is St√©phane TANG, from France. I am passionated by the TCG Altered :D.

I have open this repository to create a companion app in Python to help people to deckbuild by calculating probabilities of hand and draws for them.

The objective to this app is to answer to questions about probabilities when you deckbuild, from simple question as "How much chance I have to get this card in my hand the first turn ?", to more complex question.
